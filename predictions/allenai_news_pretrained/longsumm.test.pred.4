Most recent designs have focused on performance properties such as latency and throughput .
In this paper , we show that existing topology classes have low lifecycle management complexity by some measures , but not by others , but not by other people .
We design a new class of topologies , fatclique , that , while being performance-equivalent to existing topologies , is similar to , or better than them by all our lifecycle management complexity .
There has been a long line of work on designing datacenter topologies 35 , 31 , management ( 30 , management ) .
