Inference and decision-making approach that models vehicle behavior for both our vehicle and nearby vehicles as a set of closedloop policies that react to the actions of other agents to stop them .
Each policy captures a distinct '' high-level behavior '' behavior , such as driving along a lane or turning at an area .
we employ bayesian changepoint detection on the observed history of states of nearby cars to estimate the distribution over potential policies that each nearby car must evaluate the consequences of its potential actions . This may be because of the uncertain intentions of other traffic participants .
This work extends our previous multipolicy system [ 11 ] by using behavioral anticipation into decision-making to evaluate potential vehicle interactions .
