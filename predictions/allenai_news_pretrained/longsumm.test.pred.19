democracy is an approach to find out about learning models of individual people , and , at runtime , making the predicted preferences of those people on the dilemma at hand .
one of the key questions is which aggregation or voting rule by someone to use . We offer a book that does not want to do this .
For this reason , we seek voting rules that are robust to prediction errors , in that their output on people own , they are likely to happen with their output on noisy estimates thereof .
we prove that the borda count rule is robust in this sense , whereas any voting rule belonging to the wide family of pairwisemajority is not .
because people can express a opinion about a new person 's dilemma .
but what if we could predict the preferences of voters , instead of explicitly asking them each time common and then they would then have to go to a decision ?
This paradigm is exactly the idea behind the work of ethical decisions .
