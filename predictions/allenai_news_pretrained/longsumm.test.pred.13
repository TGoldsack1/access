results .
It is also called machine learning algorithms .
performing computations on uncertain data as if it was not exact to incorrect results .
The sensors in iot , sampling-based approximate computations and use it to modify ten applications , including ai / ml , image processing and trend analysis applications to be expressed as directed ( dags ) of free computation nodes , with data flowing through the edges for processing .
The frameworks then run applications on clusters of servers , handling issues such as task scheduling , data and data .
