It environments .
and extensible , which is made of five protocols that are designed to meet different goals ( e. g. , different performance scenarios ) .
This is because modularity in its design , features of these protocols can be mixed to achieve even more meaningful trade between functionality and performance for various applications .
through a 92 - instance , five use of amazon ec2 , we show that beat on amazon ec2 , all our beat instances significantly outperform , in terms of both latency .
