networks are important for understanding and modeling systems in physics , biology , and social science .
Many networks have rich , lower-order connectivity patterns that can be captured at the level of individual nodes and edges .
However , organization of complex networks changed the level of small network subgraphs that are not known .
we develop a good framework for clustering networks , based on higher-order patterns .
This means that mathematical guarantees on the optimality of obtained clusters and scales to networks with billions of edges .
The framework shows higher-order organization in a number of networks including information propagation units that can be used in transportation networks .
The networks show rich higher-order structures that are exposed by clusters . These structures are based on higher-order connectivity patterns .
It is based on complex networks .
