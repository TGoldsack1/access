The search is an important task that has a wide applicability in recommendation systems and classification with a large number of classes .
The solutions based on locality-sensitive ( lsh ) as well as tree-based solutions have been investigated in the recent literature , for a long time .
In this paper , we compare these to another extremely simple approach for solving mips , based on two standard recommendation system benchmarks as well as on large vocabulary word embeddings , show that this simple approach yields much higher speedups , for the same retrieval precision , than current state-of-the-art hashing and tree-based methods .
This method also gives more robust find out when the query is corrupted by noise .
The maximum inner product search ( mips ) problem has recently received increased attention , because many large tasks have been found .
