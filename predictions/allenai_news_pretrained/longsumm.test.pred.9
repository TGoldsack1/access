The development of intelligent machines is one of the biggest challenges in computer science .
In the last decades the computational community has preferred to focus on solving relatively narrow empirical problems that are important for specific applications , but do not address the overarching goal of developing general-purpose communication , as a prerequisite to be done all at once , in the last article , we propose an alternative approach : from performing menial jobs for us to helping the advance of basic and applied research .
However , the current availability of powerful hardware and large amounts of machine-readable data , as well as the widespread interest in machine learning methods , the times should be ripe for the development of intelligent machines .
and still .
